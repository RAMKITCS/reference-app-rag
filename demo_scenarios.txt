Below is a curated list of BFSI demo scenarios that perfectly expose context window challenges, retrieval failures, hallucination issues, policy logic, and the power of ACBO — all while staying realistic for underwriting, claims, audit, and risk assessment.
These are PRACTICAL inputs you can load into your system and use in live judging.

✅ TOP BFSI Demo Inputs You Can Use to Showcase ACBO vs Baseline
I grouped them into 4 categories:
	1. Underwriting Scenarios
	2. Claims Scenarios
	3. Risk & Compliance Scenarios
	4. Financial & Audit Scenarios
Each scenario includes:
	• Documents to upload
	• Query to ask
	• What Baseline RAG will miss
	• What ACBO will correctly output
This lets judges visually see the advantage.

🟦 1. UNDERWRITING SCENARIOS (Most impactful for BFSI demo)

Scenario 1 — Generate Quote from Old Policy + Loss Run
📄 Documents to upload:
	1. Old Policy PDF (40–100 pages)
	2. Loss Run (5-year history)
	3. Supplemental application or risk questionnaire
🎤 Query to ask ACBO:
	“Generate 3 quote options (basic, standard, premium) using historical losses, old policy factors, and risk characteristics. Explain the impact of each factor.”
🔻 Baseline RAG will fail:
	• Misses loss run patterns (because they are spread across pages)
	• Ignores deductible options scattered in old policy
	• Wrongly mixes premium basis
	• Hallucinates coverage factors not in documents
🔺 ACBO will produce:
	• 3 structured quote options:
		○ Limits, deductibles, premium estimates
		○ Risk-based price adjustments
	• Evidence citations: Loss Run p.4, Policy p.12, Underwriting Guide p.9
	• Confidence score
	• Token budget allocation
	• Full reasoning

Scenario 2 — Renewal Pricing from Big Documents
📄 Inputs:
	• Claims history (multi-year)
	• Old renewal quote
	• Property schedule
	• Engineering report (long → 80 pages!)
🎤 Query:
	“Provide renewal pricing recommendation with justification.”
Baseline:
❌ Misses engineering details on fire risk
❌ Omits claims frequency increases
❌ Truncates output
ACBO:
✅ Reads engineering report → picks only relevant structural risks
✅ Computes patterns across documents
✅ Full recommendation table
✅ Evidence + confidence score

Scenario 3 — Eligibility Check from Long Submission Pack
Documents:
	• 150-page submission
	• 40-page financial report
	• 20-page safety compliance report
Query:
	“Is this risk eligible for coverage under underwriting guidelines? List mandatory conditions.”

🟧 2. CLAIMS SCENARIOS (Highly impressive because ACBO shines in context engineering)

Scenario 4 — Injury Summary from Claim File (Baseline will fail dramatically)
Documents:
	• 150-page medical record
	• Policy document
	• X-ray report
	• Treatment plan
	• Doctor notes
Query:
	“Summarize claimant injuries and provide evidence-based recovery timeline.”
Baseline:
❌ Misses injuries mentioned once
❌ Confuses left/right
❌ Hallucinates treatment timeline
❌ Cannot recover scattered info
ACBO:
✅ Injury: “Left tibia mid-shaft fracture”
✅ Cites 5 evidence points
✅ Recovery timeline based on medical guidelines
✅ Clear grounded reasoning

Scenario 5 — Coverage Decision
Documents:
	• Policy wording
	• Claim description
	• Adjuster diary notes
Query:
	“Is this claim covered? Explain clause-by-clause with citations.”
Baseline:
❌ Wrong clause
❌ Misses exclusions
❌ Confusion between sections
ACBO:
✅ Checks multiple cross-references
✅ Clause-level grounding
✅ Indicates uncertainty explicitly
✅ Produces a regulatory-safe answer

Scenario 6 — Fraud Pattern Detection from Multiple PDFs
Documents:
	• Two different claim files
	• Loss run
	• Injury report
Query:
	“Do any patterns suggest potential fraud? Show evidence.”
Baseline:
❌ Cannot connect patterns (missing multi-hop reasoning)
ACBO:
✅ Identifies repeated doctor, same treatment pattern
✅ Highlights anomalies using graph
✅ Shows evidence paths

🟨 3. RISK & COMPLIANCE SCENARIOS (Very strong for BFSI judges)

Scenario 7 — AML/KYC Red Flags
Documents:
	• Customer KYC form
	• 6 months of bank statements
	• High-value transactions report
	• Sanctions list snippet
Query:
	“Identify AML red flags and potential risk score.”
Baseline:
❌ Misses cross-document transaction anomalies
❌ Cannot fuse customer profile + statements
ACBO:
✅ Finds structuring
✅ Finds cross-border high-risk transfers
✅ Matches entities in sanctions (via graph)
✅ Provides explainable reasoning

Scenario 8 — Regulatory Compliance Gap
Documents:
	• 80-page regulatory PDF
	• Bank internal SOP
	• Audit findings
Query:
	“Identify compliance gaps and provide a mitigation plan.”
Baseline: Noise, random mismatches
ACBO: Structured output, traceability

🟩 4. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND AUDIT SCENARIOS

Scenario 9 — Analytical Summary of Financial Statements
Documents:
	• Balance sheet
	• Income statement
	• Cash flow
	• Auditor’s report
	• Risk disclosures
Query:
	“Provide financial health summary and investment risk overview.”
Baseline:
❌ Wrong ratios, incomplete
ACBO:
✅ Full breakdown + evidence + confidence

Scenario 10 — Multi-Document Reconciliation
Documents:
	• Bank statement
	• Credit card statement
	• Loan agreement
Query:
	“Identify inconsistencies in financial transactions.”
ACBO shines because of cross-document linking.

⭐ BEST DEMO SCENARIO (Guaranteed to impress judges)
“Upload Old Policy + Loss Run + Submission → Generate 3 Quote Options, with evidence.”
Why it works:
	• Shows long document context handling
	• Shows RAG failures
	• Shows ACBO's budget optimizer
	• Produces a tangible business output
	• BFSI judges understand it instantly
	• Clear ROI

🧪 What Judges Will See Live
Baseline:
❌ Incomplete
❌ Wrong factors
❌ No evidence
❌ Truncated output
❌ No reasoning
ACBO:
✅ Perfect retrieval
✅ Evidence mapped with graphs
✅ Fully formatted underwriting recommendations
